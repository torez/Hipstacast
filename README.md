## Features ##

* Podcast-Management: Keep track of everything: your subscriptions, your episodes, your downloads. Hipstacast is fully configurable. You can costumize the update frequency, the number of days before the podcasts you have already listened to are deleted to keep free space and avoid using your whole free storage.

* Sharing: Share via email or through social networks the podcasts you're listening to.

* Freedom: When you start using Hipstacast we ask you if you'd like to import your current podcasts subscriptions. If you want to stop using Hipstacast, don't worry, we'll allow you to export your subscriptions.

* Improved playback: Hipstacast will remember where you left off the last time you started listening to a episode. Moreover, you can also read the episode shownotes. 

* A Worry-free experience: You don't have to remember to download the new episode. We'll do that for you. However, you are in control of everything: by default, we'll only download new episodes while on WiFi, to avoid data charges. But, don't worry!, you can change it.
